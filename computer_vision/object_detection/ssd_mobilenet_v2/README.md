### Dataset and model

Dataset can be downloaded from here: https://cocodataset.org/#download

ONNX Runtime model in fp32 precision can be downloaded here: # censored due to licensing

### Running instructions

Before running any code you should first export the PYTHONPATH variable with path pointing to the model zoo directory,
as well as AIO_NUM_THREADS specifying the number of threads to be used.

```
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/model_zoo
export AIO_NUM_THREADS=1
```

For the best experience we also recommend setting environment variables as specified below.

```
export COCO_IMG_PATH=/path/to/images
export COCO_ANNO_PATH=/path/to/annotations
```

Now you are able to run the run.py script. 

To get detailed information on the script's recognized arguments run it with -h flag for help.

The path to model (with a flag "-m") as well as its precision (with a flag "-p") have to be specified.

Please note that the default batch size is 1 and if not specified otherwise the script will run for 1 minute.

Example command for TensorFlow: 

```
python3 run.py -m /path/to/model.pb -p fp32 --framework tf
```

Example command for ONNX Runtime: 

```
python3 run.py -m /path/to/model.onnx -p fp32 --framework ort
```
