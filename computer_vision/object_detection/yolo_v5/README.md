### Dataset and model

Dataset can be downloaded from here: https://cocodataset.org/#download

PyTorch models in fp32 precision can be downloaded here:
```
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5n.pt
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5s.pt
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5m.pt
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5l.pt
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5x.pt
```

You can export a PyTorch model to Torchscript and ONNX models using [this script](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/export.py):

```
python export.py --weights yolov5s.pt --include torchscript onnx
```

### Running instructions

Before running any code you should first export the PYTHONPATH variable with path pointing to the model zoo directory,
as well as AIO_NUM_THREADS specifying the number of threads to be used.

```
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/model_zoo
export AIO_NUM_THREADS=1
```

For the best experience we also recommend setting environment variables as specified below.

```
export COCO_IMG_PATH=/path/to/images
export COCO_ANNO_PATH=/path/to/annotations
```

Now you are able to run the run.py script. 

To get detailed information on the script's recognized arguments run it with -h flag for help.

The path to model (with a flag "-m") as well as its precision (with a flag "-p") have to be specified.

Please note that the default batch size is 1 and if not specified otherwise the script will run for 1 minute.

Example command: 

```
python3 run.py -m /path/to/model.onnx -p fp32 --framework ort
```

```
python3 run.py -m /path/to/model.torchscript -p fp32 --framework pytorch
```
