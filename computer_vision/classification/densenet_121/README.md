# DenseNet 121


This folder contains the script to run DenseNet 121 on ImageNet classification task in PyTorch and ONNX Runtime framework.\

Variant supplied below for PyTorch framework in fp32 precision accepts input of shape 224x224.

Variant supplied below for ONNX Runtime framework in fp32 precision accepts input of shape 224x224.

The original paper on the architecture is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993

### Running instructions

Before running any code you should first export the PYTHONPATH variable with path pointing to the model zoo directory,
as well as DLS_NUM_THREADS specifying the number of threads to be used.

```
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/model_zoo
export DLS_NUM_THREADS=1
```

For the best experience we also recommend setting environment variables as specified below.

```
export IMAGENET_IMG_PATH=/path/to/images
export IMAGENET_LABELS_PATH=/path/to/labels
```

Now you are able to run the run.py script. 

To get detailed information on the script's recognized arguments run it with -h flag for help.

The precision (with a flag "-p") as well as framework (with a flag "--framework") have to be specified.\
Please note that the default batch size is 1 and if not specified otherwise the script will run for 1 minute.

For ONNX Runtime implementation the path to model (with a flag "-m") as well as its precision (with a flag "-p") have to be specified.


Example command for PyTorch: 

```
python3 run.py -p fp32 --framework pytorch
```

Example command for ONNX Runtime: 

```
python3 run.py -m /path/to/model.onnx -p fp32 --framework ort
```
